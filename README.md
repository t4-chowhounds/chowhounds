# Purpose
The purpose of the project was leanring to work as a team to create a web application that allows the user to find the perfect restaurant for them based on their wants, needs, and location. Based on the user's response to the zip code and the questions, a list of restaurants will be provided. The list of restaurants has other features such as yelp rankings and pproximate travel time (in minutes). Our group was able to accomplish these by using yelp API and google maps API.
